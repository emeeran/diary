"""Memorial dedication audio — plays the bundled Garden.mp3 via a system player.

Browsers block unmuted autoplay on a cold page load (no prior user gesture), so
the dedication splash can't reliably start audio from JavaScript. Instead the
local desktop backend spawns an audio player for the bundled track through the
system audio server, which is not subject to the browser's autoplay policy at
all. The frontend starts playback when the splash appears and stops it when the
splash dismisses; if no player is installed it falls back to in-browser audio.

Security: the subprocess takes **no user input** — a fixed player binary and the
bundled track path, passed as an argv list (never a shell). The endpoints are
loopback-only like the other single-user desktop endpoints.
