"""Shared tar archive helpers: safe extraction + standard backup assembly.

Two concerns live here:

* ``extract_tar_safely`` — defence-in-depth extraction used by *every* restore
  path (manual import, cloud restore). Centralises the path-traversal guard so
  it can't drift between the two duplicated call sites.
* ``add_backup_members`` — the DB (+ WAL/SHM sidecars) and ``media/`` layout
  written identically by local export, scheduled local backup, and cloud
  backup. Building them in one place keeps the three producers byte-for-byte
  consistent and lets each choose its own *target* (file vs. in-memory) without
  re-implementing the layout.
